<h4> About me </h4>
<p>
From April 2024, I am a Research Associate in the project:<br>
<a href=https://better4u.eu>"Preventing obesity through Biologically and bEhaviorally Tailored inTERventions for you - BETTER4U".</a><br>
Horizon Europe Project. Funded by the European Union.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, I  am a Ph.D. Student in the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics of Harokopio University of Athens with subject:<br>
<h4>"Bioinformatics analysis of European big data on lifestyle and genetic determinants related to body weight changes."</h4>
Supervisor: Georgios Dedoussis</p>
<p>
In August 2023, I completed the <b>M.Sc. in Statistics </b> of the Athens University of Economics and Business.<br>
My master's thesis was titled <em>"Windings of planar Brownian motion and Applications in Finance". </em>
Download it <a href="https://www.pyxida.aueb.gr/index.php?op=view_object&object_id=10675">here.</a><br>
My supervisor was <a href="https://svakeroudis.wordpress.com/"> Stavros Vakeroudis</a>.<br>
In this M.Sc. Thesis, it was dealt with 2-dimensional Brownian motion, and the way that it moves in the plane (called "windings"). 
It turns out that this study can be used to approach quantities appearing in Mathematical Finance (e.g. pricing Asian options). 
Then, some applications were illustrated, including simulations.<br><br>

In September 2021, I graduated from the department of <b> Mathematics and Applied Mathematics</b> (University of Crete) in Heraklion.<br>
My father, Giorgos, comes from a cretan village called Machera, Heraklion and my mother, Sofia, grew up in Kamena Vourla, Fthiotis. My sister's name is Matina.
